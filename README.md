# Penetration Testing with Shellcode
This is the code repository for [Penetration Testing with Shellcode](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/penetration-testing-shellcode?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788473736), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Security has always been a major concern for your application, your system, or your environment. This book's main goal is to build your skills for low-level security exploits, finding vulnerabilities and covering loopholes with Shellcode, assembly, and Metasploit.

This book will teach you topics ranging from memory management and assembly to compiling and extracting Shellcode and using syscalls and dynamically locating functions in memory. This book also covers techniques to compile 64-bit Shellcode for Linux and Windows along with Metasploit Shellcode tools. Lastly, this book will also show you to how to write your own exploits with intermediate techniques, using real-world scenarios.

By the end of this book, you will have become an expert in Shellcode and will understand how systems are compromised both at the operating system and network level.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
void main (int argc, char *argv[])

{

    int local_variable = 1;

    copytobuffer(argv[1]);

    exit(0);

}
```

Readers should have a basic understanding of operating system internals (Windows and Linux). Some knowledge of C is essential, and familiarity with Python would be helpful.

All addresses in this book are dependent on author's machine and operating system. So, addresses may vary on your machine.
